					<p>A great example of how to effectively use video on a restaurant website. As readers scroll down the page they’re drawn in by an animation of a gourmet burger that splits apart to reveal its tasty ingredients. A grid of drawn food and beverage items serves as a hub of links to your various menus, allowing customers to easily find their perfect dish.</p>

				<p>My husband, two friends and I came to lunch at Longfellows on Friday 16th December. What a find! Cosy and friendly, good atmosphere and super food (especially the spiced fruit crumble) which has gone to the top of my list for restaurant crumbles!! We will definitely be returning- thank you to all the staff. Hope we weren’t too noisy-blame the squeaky balloons!!
